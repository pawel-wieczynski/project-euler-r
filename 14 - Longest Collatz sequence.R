# Problem 14
# The following iterative sequence is defined for the set of positive integers:
#   n → n/2 (n is even)
#   n → 3n + 1 (n is odd)
# 
# Using the rule above and starting with 13, we generate the following sequence:
#   13 → 40 → 20 → 10 → 5 → 16 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1
# 
# It can be seen that this sequence (starting at 13 and finishing at 1) contains 10 terms. 
# Although it has not been proved yet (Collatz Problem), it is thought that all starting numbers finish at 1.
# 
# Which starting number, under one million, produces the longest chain?
#   
# NOTE: Once the chain starts the terms are allowed to go above one million.

best_chain_length <- 0

for (i in 1:(1e6-1)) {
  chain <- c(i)
  n <- chain[1]
  
  while (n != 1){
    if (n %% 2 == 0) n <- n/2 else n <- 3*n + 1
    chain <- append(chain, n)
  }
  
  if (length(chain) > best_chain_length){
    best_chain_length <- length(chain)
